I am now a happily married mother of two children ages 12 and 7. I wish to continue to study and grow independently. My priorities are to give a better life to my family, and also better myself as a professional business person. I have lived a hard life but there are many obstacles I've had to overcome. We have lived off of very low income but I maintain very positive outlook. I have my priorities set. I am looking ahead and becoming innovative, always  looking for different opportunities and anything that will help me become the person I want to become. Having children has brought me close to my children since I have more time for them. I have various clients and I have had good business. Growing my business is something I have been working towards for years. My future goal is to have employees and also give opportunity to people less fortunate than I have been growing up.\"}},\n",

We experienced this pressure while operating our own tiki bar in Hawaii. The craft cocktail and artisan food product industries emphasize locality and seasonality, but pursuing that goal means a lot of time, labor, and expense. For that reason, the industry is trending toward incorporating more preserved garnishes, but there's limited creativity and variety in the products currently available on the market.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was our incentive to create HI &amp; Dry, where we do the fussy prep work so our customers don't have to. Brice has a mad scientist streak; he's a creative troubleshooter driven to try new things and improve existing ones. We purchase and dehydrate only Hawaiian-grown fruits and vegetables, and use them to create beautiful and inventive tropical garnishes for food and beverages.  It's important that our business aligns with our values: supporting small local farmers, reducing food waste, and easing the workload for other small businesses -- which in turn helps them deliver more interesting food/beverage products to their customers. The bonus is that we also get to showcase the amazing variety of products we are lucky enough to enjoy every day on Big Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we were passionate tropical cocktail enthusiasts before we were business owners, committed to using local, quality ingredients from farm to glass. However, a lot of those products are expensive, fragile, and have a short shelf life once they are picked. HI &amp; Dry products will extend that shelf life, enabling the whole world to experience some aloha wherever they are, and enjoy Hawaiian produce year-round in their drinks and on their plates.\"}},\n",
